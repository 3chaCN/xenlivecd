 * Add a serial menu option in GRUB, like this:

  Xen hypervisor options: com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,tty 
  Linux options: console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty0

 * Add to the guide the steps involved in:

   qcow2, lvm2 snapshots, bond network, vlan, bridge, more snmpd and scripts for cacti 
   Multiple Network Cards + Multiple Bridges on debian lenny
   NFS Server, iSCSI & live motion

 * Install ConVirt via APT inside the chrooted dom0.

 Future releases:

 0.9 Not released. Change the default GUI manager to ConVirt 1.1.

 1.0 Not released. Make Xen Live CD with full Gnome desktop environment (without
    any domUs, of course)? But with full GUI management and with Debian Live
    Installer!

 1.1 Not released. Make a DVD version with more and full guests installations?

 1.2 Not released. Forget about pre-installed domUs and make a small Xen Live
    CD, but with a Debian Live Installer?

 1.3 Not released. Add OpenQRM or other web tool to make the Xen Live CD 100%
    useful from the user point of view?



 * I think will be nice to merge the ideas behind this scripts to the
 live-helper itself. So in future versions of live-helper, we can create a new
 Xen Live CD just passing some options to live-helper, instead doing all this
 work manually.
