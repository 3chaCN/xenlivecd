 * I think will be nice to merge the ideas behind this scripts to the
 live-helper itself. So in future versions of live-helper, we can create a new
 Xen Live CD just passing some options to live-helper, instead doing all this
 work manually.

 Future releases:

 0.9 Not released. Make a PowerPC version of the Xen Live CD?

 1.0 Not released. Make Xen Live CD with full desktop Gnome environment (without
    any domUs, of course)? But with full GUI management and with Debian Live
    Installer!

 1.1 Not released. Make a DVD version with more and full guests installations?

 1.2 Not released. Forget about pre-installed domUs and make a small Xen Live
    CD, but with a Debian Live Installer?

 1.3 Not released. Add OpenQRM or other web tool to make the Xen Live CD 100%
    useful from the user point of view?
