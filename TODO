 * Add to the guide the steps involved in:

   qcow2, lvm2 snapshots, bond network, vlan, bridge, more snmpd and scripts for cacti 
   Multiple Network Cards + Multiple Bridges on debian lenny
   NFS Server, iSCSI & live motion

 Future releases:

 0.9 Not released. Change the default GUI manager to ConVirt 1.1.

 1.2 Include a Debian Live Installer?

 * I think will be nice to merge the ideas behind this scripts to the
 live-helper itself. So in future versions of live-helper, we can create a new
 Xen Live CD just passing some options to live-helper, instead doing all this
 work manually.
